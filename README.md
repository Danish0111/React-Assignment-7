## 🧠 Short Answers

### 1. What is Redux and why is it used in React applications?
**Redux is a state management library used to store and manage global application data in a predictable way. It helps avoid prop drilling and keeps state centralized.**

### 2. Difference between useSelector() and useDispatch()?
**useSelector() reads data from the Redux store, while useDispatch() sends actions to the store to update the state.**

### 3. What is the role of a reducer in Redux?
**A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new updated state.**

### 4. How does createAsyncThunk() help in Redux Toolkit?
**createAsyncThunk() simplifies handling asynchronous operations like API calls and automatically manages loading, success, and error states.**

### 5. Purpose of the Provider component?
**Provider wraps the entire React app and makes the Redux store available to all components via React context.**
